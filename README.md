# Bond-Themes-
I've been tinkering around with text analysis of bond themes. I'll post a notebook/blog post at some point. But it you wanted to play with the data then here's two CSV files
+ `bondwithlyrics.csv` - this is a basic csv with data on bond films scraped from Wikipedia and the lyrics to each tune scraped from Lyric Genius
+ `bondthemesdata.csv` - this is an updated version of `bondwithlyrics.csv` where I've saved more data e.g. I've saved tokenised versions of the lyrics and some numbers related to that e.g. Wordcounts, lexical diversity etc. I think it'll make more sense when I've done a write up but I've included it for fun.
