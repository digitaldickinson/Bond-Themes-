 Much wiser since my good-bye to you
 I've traveled the world to learn
 I must return from Russia with love
 I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment
 But oh, you haunted me so
 Still my tongue tied young pride
 Ld not let my love for you show in case you'd say no
 To Russia I flew but there and then
 I suddenly knew you'd care again
 My running around is through
 I fly to you from Russia with love"
2,Goldfinger,1964,Sean Connery,124.9,820.4,3,18.6,170,Goldfinger,Shirley Bassey,"Goldfinger
 He's the man
 The man with the Midas touch
 A spider's touch
 Such a cold finger
 Beckons you to enter his web of sin
 But don't go in
 Golden words he will pour in your ear
 But his lies can't disguise what you fear
 For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
 It's the kiss of death from Mr. Goldfinger
 Pretty girl, beware of his heart of gold
 This heart is cold
 Golden words he will pour in your ear
 But his lies can't disguise what you fear
 For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
 It's the kiss of death from Mr. Goldfinger
 Pretty girl, beware of his heart of gold
 This heart is cold
 He loves only gold
 Only gold
 He loves gold
 He loves only gold
 Only gold
 He loves gold"

 He acts while other men just talk
 He looks at this world, and wants it all
 So he strikes, like Thunderball
 He knows the meaning of success
 His needs are more, so he gives less
 They call him the winner who takes all
 And he strikes, like Thunderball
 Any woman he wants, he'll get
 He will break any heart without regret
 His days of asking are all gone
 His fight goes on and on and on
 But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
 So he strikes, like Thunderball"

 Or so it seems
 One life for yourself
 And one for your dreams
 You drift through the years
 And life seems tame
 'Til one dream appears
 And Love is its name
 And love is a stranger
 Who'll beckon you on
 Don't think of the danger
 Or the stranger is gone
 This dream is for you
 So pay the price
 Make one dream come true
 You only live twice
 And love is a stranger
 Who'll beckon you on
 Don't think of the danger
 Or the stranger is gone
 This dream is for you
 So pay the price
 Make one dream come true
 You only live twice"

 To unfold all the precious things

 We need nothing more
 Every step of the way
 Will find us
 With the cares of the world
 Far behind us
 We have all the time in the world
 Just for love
 Nothing more, nothing less

 They are all I need to please me
 They can stimulate and tease me
 They won't leave in the night
 I've no fear that they might desert me
 Diamonds are forever
 Hold one up and then caress it
 Touch it, stroke it and undress it
 I can see every part
 Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
 I don't need love
 For what good will love do me?
 Diamonds never lie to me
 For when love's gone
 They'll luster on
 Diamonds are forever
 Sparkling round my little finger
 Unlike men, the diamonds linger;
 Men are mere mortals who
 Are not worth going to your grave for
 I don't need love
 For what good will love do me?
 Diamonds never lie to me
 For when love's gone
 They'll luster on
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

 When you got a job to do
 You got to do it well
 You got to give the other fellow hell

 Makes you give in and cry
 Say live and let die

 He charges a million a shot
 An assassin that's second to none
 The man with the golden gun
 Lurking in some darkened doorway
 Or crouched on a roof top somewhere
 In the next room, or this very one
 The man with the golden gun
 Love is required whenever he's hired
 It comes just before the kill
 No-one can catch him, no hit man can match him
 For his million dollar skill
 One golden shot means another poor victim
 Has come to a glittering end
 For a price, he'll erase anyone
 The man with the golden gun
 His eye may be on you or me
 Who will he bang?
 We shall see
 Oh yeah!
 Love is required whenever he's hired
 It comes just before the kill
 No-one can catch him, no hit man can match him

 One golden shot means another poor victim
 Has come to a glittering end
 If you want to get rid of someone
 The man with the golden gun
 Will get it done
 He'll shoot anyone
 With his golden gun"

 Baby, you‚Äôre the best
 I wasn‚Äôt looking
 But somehow you found me
 I tried to hide from your love light
 But like heaven above me
 The spy who loved me
 Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
 And nobody does it better
 Though sometimes I wish someone could
 Nobody does it quite the way you do
 Why d‚Äôyou have to be so good?
 The way that you hold me
 Whenever you hold me
 There‚Äôs some kind of magic inside you
 That keeps me from running
 But just keep it comin‚Äô
 How‚Äôd you learn to do the things you do?
 Oh, and nobody does it better

 Why do you hide
 Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side
 Just like the moonraker goes
 In search of his dream of gold
 I search for love
 For someone to have and hold
 I've seen your smile
 In a thousand dreams
 Felt your touch
 And it always seems
 You love me
 You love me
 Where are you
 When will we meet
 Take my unfinished life and make it complete
 Just like the moonraker knows
 His dream will come true someday

 Are only a kiss away

 Felt your touch
 And it always seems
 You love me

 So much in me that's new
 I never felt, until I looked at you
 For your eyes only, only for you
 You see what no one else can see
 Now I'm breaking free
 For your eyes only, only for you
 The love I know you need in me
 The fantasy you freed in me
 Only for you, only for you
 For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
 You really know me, that's all I need to know
 Maybe I'm an open book
 Because I know you're mine
 But you won't need to read between the lines
 For your eyes only, only for you
 You see what no one else can see
 Now I'm breaking free
 For your eyes only, only for you
 The passions that collide in me
 The wild abandoned side of me
 Only for you, for your eyes only"

 Funny how it always goes with love
 When you don't look, you find
 But then we're two of a kind, we move as one
 We're an all time high
 We'll change all that's gone before
 Doing so much more than falling in love
 On an all time high
 We'll take on the world and wait
 So hold on tight, let the flight begin
 I don't want to waste a waking moment
 I don't want to sleep
 I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
 In my time
 I've said these words before
 But now I realize
 My heart was telling me lies
 For you they're true
 We're an all time high
 We'll change all that's gone before
 Doing so much more than falling in love

 Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
 Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
 A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
 A week is why, until we...
 Dance into the fire
 That fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire
 To fatal sounds of broken dreams
 Dance into the fire
 That fatal kiss is all we need
 Dance into the fire
 The choice for you is the view to a kill
 Between the shades assassination standing still
 Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
 First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
 A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
 A chance to die, but can we...
 Dance into the fire

 Dance into the fire
 To fatal sounds of broken dreams
 Dance into the fire
 That fatal kiss is all we need

 More than darkness in the depths
 See him surface in every shadow
 On the wind I feel his breath

 Golden eye he'll do what I please
 Golden eye no time for sweetness

 You'll never know how I watched you
 From the shadows as a child
 You'll never know how it feels to be the one
 Who's left behind
 You'll never know the days, the nights
 The tears, the tears I've cried
 But now my time has come
 And time, time is not on your side
 See him move through smoke and mirrors
 Feel his presence in the crowd
 Other girls they gather around him
 If I had him I wouldn't let him out
 Golden eye not lace or leather
 Golden chains take him to the spot
 Golden eye I'll show him forever
 It'll take forever to see
 What I've got
 You'll never know how I watched you
 From the shadows as a child
 You'll never know how it feels to get so close
 And be denied
 It's a gold and honey trap
 I've got for you tonight
 Revenge it's a kiss, this time I won't miss
 Now I've got you in my sight
 With a Golden eye
 Golden, golden eye
 With a golden eye
